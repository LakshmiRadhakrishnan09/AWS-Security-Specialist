### AWS Managed Services

AWS Managed Services offers two operations plans to meet your needs: 1) AWS Managed Services Accelerate for your new and existing AWS accounts via detective controls, giving you full control and flexibility to use AWS as you always have, and 2) AWS Managed Services Advanced with preventative controls via a change management system within an AWS managed landing zone, which provides a full operational solution and trades some flexibility for increased operational rigor to protect your critical business applications. Customers can select either operations plan on an account by account basis.

AWS Managed Services (AMS) specializes in managing AWS infrastructure and services. AMS **automates common activities such as change requests, monitoring, patch management, security, and backup services, and provides full-lifecycle services to provision, run, and support your infrastructure.**

As an Infrastructure Operator, AMS takes responsibility for deploying a suite of security detective controls and provides a 24/7 first line of response to alerts, using a follow-the-sun model. When an alert is triggered, AMS follows a standard set of automated and manual runbooks to ensure a consistent response. These runbooks are shared with AMS customers during onboarding so they can develop and coordinate response with AMS. AMS encourages the joint execution of security response simulations with customers to develop operational muscle before a real incident occurs.

### AWS Support

AWS Support offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support the success and operational health of your AWS solutions. All support plans provide 24/7 access to customer service, AWS documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. If you need technical support and more resources to help plan, deploy, and optimize your AWS environment, you can select a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.

## AWS Shield

AWS offers customers AWS Shield, which provides a managed **DDoS protection service** that safeguards web applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There are two tiers of AWS Shield: Standard and Advanced.

All AWS customers benefit from the no cost, automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard. AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your website or applications. When you use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks.

For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your web applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 resources, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Additionally, AWS Shield Advanced gives you 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).
