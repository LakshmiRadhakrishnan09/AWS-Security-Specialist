## S3

Objects stored in a region. Accessible from anywhere from world. Unlimited storage.

#### Availability

Multiple copies in multiple AZz. 

#### Consistency

Till 2020: Strong read after write consistenyc for new objects. Eventual consistency for deletes and updates. In 2021, Strong consistency for all operations. A subsequent read will get lastest operation.

#### Bucket Object ownership

Bucket owner and object owner can be in different accounts(cross-accounts). Till 2020, bucket owner cannot access object, until object owner grant access using ACL.
After 2021, we can disbale ACL and bucket owner can take ownership of all objects. 

#### S3 Storage Classes


- Standard
   - Only pay for storage. **No retrieval fee.**. There is retrieval fee for all other class. **No minimum days** charge.
- Infrequent Access : Minimum 30 days. 128 KB.
- OneZone IA: Minimum 30 days. 128 KB. Ideal for secondary backup or easily recreatable data.

S3 Intelligent Tiering: Automatically change class based on usage. \
 - Suitable for unknown accessible patterns or changing patterns
 - Each object is tracked and transitioned between storage classes independently
 - Objcet must be minimum 128 kb
 - Small monitoring fee
 - Optinally enable deep archieve class

 - Configure expiration

Storage Class Analysis \
Storage Lens

#### Versioning

By default , updates and deletes are not reversible.

Enabled at bucket level

If version1 is 10GB, version2 is 12GB, even if you delete, u need to pay for 22GB. (Delete will add a delete marker, will not delete actual v1 and v2 data.)

Get operation returns current version. \
If u have a delete marker,then GET will return NOT FOUND. \
Delete without object versionId --> will add delete marker. \
Delete with object versionId --> delete actual version. \
Delete the delete marker --> will restore the old object version \
To restore a version --> Get a version and put it as new version \
Life cycle rules can be configured for versions

#### Life cycle rules

Filter by prefix, tags

Tiering, Expiration, For current and previous versions use different storage class.

Aggregate small objects to large objects if u are using IA.


#### Access Controls

User based policies

Resource Based polcies
- Bucket policy : Can grant cross account access. You can enforce Network Origin restrictions. For eg: Bucket accessible from a network only.
- Bucket Access Control Policy : Only recommended use for Bucket ACL is "Grant Access to S3 Log Delivery Group to write S3 access Logs". Bucket ACL is the only mechanism to grant S3 Log capture. U can grant cross account access.
- Object Access Control Policy : Useful when permission vary for each objcet. Only way to grant access to bucket owner by object owner.

#### Replication

Cross Region Replication - For Dister recovery, For minimizing latency for users in different regions \
Same Region Replication - For Aggregate logs to a single bucket. Replicate from production to test envt. 

Only new objets replicated. For existing objects use batch copy tools.

Deletes are not replicated. 

Replication time control : When enabled Replicates 99.9% objects in 15 minutes. SLAs applicable. Additional charges apply.

#### Performance

Max size of single object is 5TB. Max upload in single PUT is 5GB.

Use multi-part transfer for PUT and GET. Recommended for objects > 100MB.

For high throughput - use different prefix. For eg: for log files dont use year-month as prefix.Use random prefix.

CloudFront Content Delivery

Transfer Acceleration: for uploads to S3 bucket from all over the world.

Byte Range Fetcher

ElasticCache

Keep Compute and Storage in same region

USe batch operations for large operations

### Storage Gateway

Extend S3 to onpremise

On-premise ------   File Gateway(Network File System) --------------------------------- S3 \
On-premise ------   Volume Gateway(Block) ----------------------------------------------S3 \
On-premise ------   Tape Gateway ------------------------------------------------------- S3 \
           
Volume Gateway:
  - Cached mode: Primary storage is S3. Gateway maintains a local cache of recently accessed data.
  - Stored Volume mode: Entire data is available locally in gateway. Changes asynchronously copied to S3.

File Gateway: Objects in S3 can be directly accessed in S3 APIs. \
Volume Gateway:Data stored in S3. Cannot be accessed directly by S3 APIs. Take EBS snapshot to create new storage gateway volume or EBS volumes. \
Tape Gateway: Data stored in S3. Cannot be accessed directly by S3 APIs. Accessed by Tape Gateway APIs. 


### Server Side Encryption

* SSE-S3 : Key not in ur account. Key managed by AWS S3. server-side-encryption:AES256
* SSE-KMS : Key in ur account. Generated by AWS. Managed by u. server-side-encryption:aws-kms
* SSE-C:  With Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption, when you access your objects. S3 use the key provided in request.server-side-encryption-customer-alogorithm:AES256
* Client Side encryption

Apply at object level or bucket 

##### SFTP to transfer data to S3

- Secure FTP Service
- Attach Role


##### CORS

www.example.com --- to access ---> s3.awazon.com

Browser includes Origin: www.example.com

Configure CORS permission in S3 Bucket. AllowedOrigin: www.example.com

S3 includs Access-Control-Allow-Origin: www.example.com

##### Pre signed URL

Grant temporary access to unaunthenticated users. U set expiry time

The profile used for signing should have least priveledges.

##### S3 Select and Glacier Select

Using SQL to query data

##### Object Lock

WORM - Write Once Read Many. Regulatory requirement. Prevent an object from overriden or deleted 

- Rentention Period
      - Governance Mode: some users with special permissions have the flexibility to alter the retention settings or delete the objects. 
      - Compliance Mode: No user able to delete the objects during a pre-defined retention period. Note: The only way to delete an object under the                                 Compliance mode before its retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.
- Legal Hold: No retension period. You must explicily remove the legal hold.

A S3 Glacier vault access policy is a resource-based policy that you can use to manage permissions to your vault. A Vault Lock policy is a vault access policy that can be locked. After you lock a Vault Lock policy, the policy cannot be changed. You can use a Vault Lock policy to enforce compliance controls.

A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId). 

ABORT Lock: If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. This operation stops the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state. . Stopping the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault.

### Key Policy

- Every KMS key must have exactly one key policy. 
- Key policy will not allow access to anyone. Use IAM policy to grant access.
- "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource" access only using a AWS resource

The key policy statement shown below gives the AWS account that owns the key permission to use IAM policies, as well as key policies, to allow all actions (kms:*) on the KMS key. When the principal in a key policy statement is the account principal, the policy statement doesn't give any IAM users or roles permission to use the KMS key. Instead, it allows the account to use IAM policies to delegate the permissions specified in the policy statement. This default key policy statement allows the account to use IAM policies to delegate permission for all actions (kms:*) on the KMS key.

IAM policies by themselves are not sufficient to allow access to a CMK. However, you can use them in combination with a CMK's key policy if the key policy enables it. Giving the AWS account full access to the CMK does this; it enables you to use IAM policies to give IAM users and roles in the account access to the CMK. It does not by itself give any IAM users or roles access to the CMK, but it enables you to use IAM policies to do so. For more information, see Managing access to AWS KMS CMKs.  The following example shows the policy statement that allows access to the AWS account and thereby enables IAM policies.  

```
{ "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions", "Effect": "Allow", 
"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"}, 
"Action": "kms:*", "Resource": "*" }
```


The **canonical user ID** is an alpha-numeric identifier, such as 79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be, that is an obfuscated form of the AWS account ID. You can use this ID to identify an AWS account when granting cross-account access to buckets and objects using Amazon S3. You can retrieve the canonical user ID for your AWS account as either the root user or an IAM user.

When configuring Origin Identity Access as S3 policy, u use canonical user id as Principal.



### Accessing S3 - Same account and different account

Same Account( Only one is needed)
- Using bucket policy
- Using IAM

Using bucket policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1606557924566",
    "Statement": [
        {

            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mountain-pics/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Using IAM policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mountain-pics/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Cross Account

Need both bucket Policy and IAM policy ( Both should be there)

Bucket Policy for S3 in Account A
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1606557924566",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1606557921184",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mountain-pics/*"
        }
    ]
}

```
IAM policy for user in Account B.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mountain-pics/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Cross-account bucket access with STS assume role

- Account A with S3. Account B want to access S3
- Create Role in Account A. This role should have access for S3( Bucket or IAM. One of this)
- Role must have a trust relationship with account B, allowing users in account B to perform sts:AssumeRole
- User in account B must have the permission for the sts:AssumeRole action, to assume the role in Account A

Trust Policy
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountB:user/AccountBUserName"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
Policy to assume Role
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::AccountA:role/AccountARole"
  }
}
```

S3 ACLs can be applied at bucket level and objet level. when a bucket is created a bucket ACL is automatically generated for you giving the bucket owner (the AWS account) full control.

When we create a object, set --acl bucket-owner-full-control flag means that even though this object is created by another account, the account which owns the bucket will be given full control of the object.


**When objects are being added to a bucket from another AWS account**

For existing Amazon S3 buckets with the default object ownership settings, the object owner is the AWS account which uploaded the object to the bucket. For these existing buckets, an object owner had to explicitly grant permissions to an object (by attaching an access control list).  

With S3 Object Ownership, bucket owners can now manage the ownership of any objects uploaded to their buckets. By default, all newly created S3 buckets have the bucket owner enforced setting enabled.
