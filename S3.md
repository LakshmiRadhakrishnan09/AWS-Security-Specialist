## S3

Objects stored in a region. Accessible from anywhere from world. Unlimited storage.

#### Availability

Multiple copies in multiple AZz. 

#### Consistency

Till 2020: String read after write consistenyc for new objects. Eventual consistency for deletes and updates. In 2021, Strong consistency for all operations. A subsequent read will get lastest operation.

#### Bucket Object ownership

Bucket owner and object owner can be in different accounts(cross-accounts). Till 2020, bucket owner cannot access object, until object owner grant access using ACL.
After 2021, we can disbale ACL and bucket owner can take ownership of all objects. 

#### S3 Storage Classes


- Standard
   - Only pay for storage. **No retrieval fee.**. There is retrieval fee for all other class. **No minimum days** charge.
- Infrequent Access : Minimum 30 days. 128 KB.
- OneZone IA: Minimum 30 days. 128 KB. Ideal for secondary backup or easily recreatable data.
- Glacier Instant Retrieval : Immediate Access. Minimum 90 days. 128 KB.
- Glacier Flexible Retrieval : Several minutes to hours to retrieve. Minimum 90 days. 40 KB.
      * Expediate and Standard(5 hours) and Bulk(12 hours)
- Glacier Deep Archieve : Several Hours to retrieve. Minimum 180 days. 40 KB.
      * Standard(12 hours) and Bulk(48 hours)

S3 Intelligent Tiering: Automatically change class based on usage. \
 - Suitable for unknown accessible patterns or changing patterns
 - Each object is tracked and transitioned between storage classes independently
 - Objcet must be minimum 128 kb
 - Small monitoring fee
 - Optinally enable deep archieve class
 - Minimun storage charge for 30 days
Life Cycle Configuration: Define rules based on age. 
 - When u know usage pattern
 - For CloudTrailLogs
 - Configure expiration

Storage Lens

#### Versioning

By default , updates and deletes are not reversible.

Enabled at bucket level

If version1 is 10GB, version2 is 12GB, even if you delete, u need to pay for 22GB. (Delete will add a delete marker, will not delete actual v1 and v2 data.)

Get operation returns current version. \
If u have a delete marker,then GET will return NOT FOUND. \
Delete without version --> will add delete marker. \
Delete with version --> delete actual version. \
Delete the delete marker --> will restore the old object version \
To restore a version --> Get a version and put it as new version \
Life cycle rules can be configured for versions

#### Life cycle rules

Filter by prefix, tags

Tiering, Expiration, For current and previous versions use different storage class.

Aggregate small objects to large objects if u are using IA.


#### Access Controls

User based policies

Resource Based polcies
- Bucket policy : Can grant cross account access. You can enforce Network Origin restrictions. For eg: Bucket accessible from a network only.
- Bucket Access Control Policy : Only recommended use for Bucket ACL is "Grant Access to S3 Log Delivery Group to write S3 access Logs". Bucket ACL is the only mechanism to grant S3 Log capture. U can grant cross account access.
- Object Access Control Policy : Useful when permission vary for each objcet. Only way to grant access to bucket owner by object owner.

#### Replication

Cross Region Replication - For Dister recovery, For minimizing latency for users in different regions \
Same Region Replication - For Aggregate logs to a single bucket. Replicate from production to test envt. 

Only new objets replicated. For existing objects use batch copy tools.

Deletes are not replicated. 

Replication time control : When enabled Replicates 99.9% objects in 15 minutes. SLAs applicable. Additional charges apply.

#### Performance

Max size of single object is 5TB. Max upload in single PUT is 5GB.

Use multi-part transfer for PUT and GET. Recommended for objects > 100MB.

For high throughput - use different prefix. For eg: for log files dont use year-month as prefix.Use random prefix.

CloudFront Content Delivery

Transfer Acceleration: for uploads to S3 bucket from all over the world.

Byte Range Fetcher

ElasticCache

Keep Compute and Storage in same region

USe batch operations for large operations

### Storage Gateway

Extend S3 to onpremise

On-premise ------   File Gateway(Network File System)
           ------   Volume Gateway(Block) --------------------------------- S3
           ------   Tape Gateway
           
Volume Gateway:
  - Cached mode: Primary storage is S3. Gateway maintains a local cache of recently accessed data.
  - Stored Volume mode: Entire data is available locally in gateway. Changes asynchronously copied to S3.

File Gateway: Objects in S3 can be directly accessed in S3.
Volume Gateway:Data stored in S3. Cannot be accessed directly by S3 APIs. Take EBS snapshot to create new storage gateway volume or EBS volumes.
Tape Gateway: Data stored in S3. Cannot be accessed directly by S3 APIs. Accessed by Tape Gateway APIs.
